## Installation

To make settings work across all apps in **iOS 14** & **MacOS Big Sur**, you’ll need to install configuration profile. This profile would tell operating system to use DOH / DOT. Note: it’s not enough to simply set server IPs in System Preferences — you need to install a profile.

To install, simply open the file in GitHib, and then click/tap on install button. The profile should download. On macOS, double click on the downloaded file to open it in settings, and approve instalation. On iOS, go to **System Settings => General => Profile**, select downloaded profile and tap the “Install” button.

## Signed Profiles

In the signed folder, we have signed versions of the profiles in this repository. These profiles have been signed by [@Candygoblen123](https://github.com/Candygoblen123) so that when you install the profiles, they will have a verified check box on the installation screen. It also ensures that these profiles have not been tampered with. However, since they were signed by a third party, they may lag behind their unsigned counterparts a little.

[comment]: <> (We recommend that you install a signed profile instead of an unsigned profile because it ensures that it was not modified while it was downloading.)

To verify resolver IPs and hostnames, compare mobileconfig files to their documentation URLs. Internal workings of the profiles are described on [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings). In order to verify signed mobileconfigs, you will need to download them to your computer and open them in a text editor, because signing profiles makes GitHub think that they are binary files.

## Known issues

We can't fix the issues, only Apple can:

- [Little Snitch / Lulu disable Encrypted DNS](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns/issues/13)
- [Some traffic e.g. Terminal / App Store is except from EDNS](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns/issues/22)
- [Chrome is except from EDNS](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns/issues/19)
- [VPN disable EDNS](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns/issues/18)
